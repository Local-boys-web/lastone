// Central export file for all services
// This allows cleaner imports like: import { adminService, jobService } from 'services';

export { default as adminService } from './adminService';
export { default as recruiterService } from './recruiterService';
export { default as userService } from './userService';
export { default as jobService } from './jobService';
export { default as api } from './api';
